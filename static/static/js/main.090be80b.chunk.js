Three exhibitions each year explore the making of British gardens, and a programme of over 30 talks and interviews celebrates heroes and heroines from the forgotten plant-hunters and gardeners of the past to the designers and writers in fashion today. Visitors will also see a permanent display of paintings, tools, ephemera and historic artefacts: a glimpse into the uniquely British love affair with gardens.The Museum\\\\u2019s garden was created in 1980. At its heart is a knot garden designed by the Museum\\\\u2019s President, The Dowager Marchioness of Salisbury (who was then also re-making the gardens at Hatfield House, Hertfordshire). The reason for the seventeenth-century spirit of the design is that our garden also houses the tomb of the great plant-hunters, gardeners and collectors, John Tradescant the Elder and Younger, the rediscovery of which originally inspired the creation of a museum of garden history in the deconsecrated, and then derelict, church of St Mary-at-Lambeth. The knot garden and its surrounds are planted with species introduced by the Tradescants - such as the scarlet runner bean, red maple and tulip tree - and many others grown by them in their Lambeth garden.

Formed in 1933, the Library\'s unique collection of over one million items includes published and unpublished works, press cuttings, photographs and eyewitness testimony.\\\\n\\\\nThe Library traces its roots back to Germany in the 1920s. Dr Alfred Wiener, a German Jew, having fought in WWI, returned to Germany in 1919 and was horrified at the surge of right-wing antisemitism, which blamed Jews for the defeat.\\\\n\\\\nDr Wiener worked with the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith to combat antisemitism, writing, lobbying and speaking publicly. From 1925 (the year Hitler published Mein Kampf) he perceived a greater threat from the Nazi Party than any other antisemitic group or party. Under his influence an archive was started just to collect information about the Nazis, which formed the basis of campaigns to undermine their activities.\\\\n\\\\nDr Wiener and his family fled Germany in 1933 and settled in Amsterdam.  Dr Wiener\'s first archive is believed to have been destroyed. Later that year he set up the Jewish Central Information Office at the request of the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Anglo-Jewish Association.  The JCIO essentially continued the work of the earlier archive.\\\\n\\\\nFollowing the November Pogrom of 1938, Wiener prepared to bring his collection to the UK. It arrived the following summer and is believed to have opened on the day the Nazis invaded Poland.\\\\n\\\\nThroughout the War the JCIO served the British Government as it fought the Nazi regime. Increasingly the collection was referred to as \\\\u2018Dr Wiener\'s Library\' and eventually this led to its renaming.\\\\n\\\\nPost-war, the Library assisted the prosecutors at the Nuremberg Trial, amassed early survivor testimony and helped to shape the emerging academic study of the Holocaust.\\\\n\\\\nToday, the collection is among the largest and most respected in the world and continues to grow. In 2011 it moved to new premises in Russell Square and began a programme funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund to improve access and open its collections to the widest possible audience.","Locality":"London WC1B 5DP, England","Price":"No price information"},{"Attraction name":"Statue of Amy Winehouse-London England","Time range":"12:00 AM - 11:59 PM","Description":"No description","Locality":"London NW1 8AH, England","Price":"$164.25"},{"Attraction name":"Hackney Museum-London England","Time range":"9:30 AM - 5:30 PM","Description":"No description","Locality":"London E8 1GQ, England","Price":"No price information"},{"Attraction name":"House of Illustration-London England","Time range":"11:00 AM - 5:30 PM","Description":"House of Illustration is the UK\'s only public gallery dedicated solely to illustration, with a creative programme of exhibitions, talks and events.
